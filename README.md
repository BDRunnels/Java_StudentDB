* Student DB *
    - DB Admin for University. Need to create app to manage student enrollments and balance.

    App should do the following:
        Ask user how many new students will be added to DB.
        User should be prompted to enter the name and year for each student
        Student should have  5 digit unique ID with the first number being their grade level.
        Student can enroll in:
            History, Mathematics, English, Chemistry, Computer Science 101.
        Each course costs $600
        The student should be able to view their balance and pay tuition.
        To see the status of the student, we should see their name ID courses enrolled and balance.
